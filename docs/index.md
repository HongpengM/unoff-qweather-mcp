## What is MCP?

[MCP (Multiagent Conversation Protocol)](https://mcp.so) is a protocol for connecting AI models and agents to external tools, APIs, and data sources. It enables:

- Building modular tools for AI agents

- Creating a ecosystem of specialized tools

This package combines QWeather's data services with MCP's tool protocol to make weather data easily accessible to AI agents and applications.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the package
pip install unoff-qweather-mcp

# Set up environment variables
export QWEATHER_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
export QWEATHER_API_HOST="api.qweather.com"

# Run the MCP server
python -m unoff_qweather.qweather
```

Then in your client code:

```python
from mcp.client import Client

client = Client("unoff-qweather-mcp")

# Get weather for a city
cities = await client.lookup_city(location="London")
location_id = cities["location"][0]["id"]
weather = await client.weather_now(location=location_id)

print(f"Current weather in London: {weather['now']['text']}, {weather['now']['temp']}Â°C")
```
